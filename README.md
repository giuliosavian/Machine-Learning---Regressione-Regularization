## Intro Of The Project
This project has been made by myself from the machine learning course in the university of Padua.

In this notebook we are going to explore the use of Regression Regularization on House Pricing Dataset

We are going to touch: 
1. Ridge regression 
2. Lasso
3. How do LS, Ridge and LASSO reject redundant/useless feature?
4. Homoschedasticity vs Eteroschedasticity
